 ## Challenges & Future Enhancements
 ### **Challenges Faced**
 -  Faced React and MUI version mismatches and had to troubleshoot dependency conflicts.
-  Managing role-based routes for admin and user was initially complex.
- Handling form validations and file uploads (e.g., event images) needed additional logic.
-Firebase CLI deployment errors led to delays; the fallback was to run locally.
-Setting up dummy payment and booking flow to simulate a realistic experience took time to refine.
